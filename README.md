- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilesVedder.  This is my swank new git repository.  I'm still decorating, so be patient.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things MDM, configurator profiling, certs, tokens, permissions and
VMware.  I'm also into working copy and committing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect the dots and solve mysteries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music and configuration implementation.
And painting. And all that is git Apache, amp and chromium too.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
